This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Swift Medical

Had fun doing this little project. It took me a couple of hours. 
I have used React.js and Redux. 

I also used some libraries for the rooting (react-router-dom) and some others for multiple reasons (see package.json)

## Room for Improvement

I could totally have done some refactoring and create more components. I choose not too as the app is very small and at this point reusability of components is not necessary as the specs are very simple.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
(Wounds demo API runs in http://localhost:3000)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

## Make sure to run the Wounds demo API using Swagger.

## End result
